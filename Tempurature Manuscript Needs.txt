SST daily for all lakes 
Landsat ARD SST product
Clouds in lake or scene it decreases temp
Use in situ temp data to inform model instead

Tested
L-ARD lake no cloud, scene w cloud
L-ARD scene wo cloud
In situ

Big gap in east of data for scenes wo any clouds

Suspicious that there was a download error

Some files got reorganized so pull them back out to run the code

Action <- GEE vs whats been downloaded to see whats missing

Model should output a daily temp forcast and its not doing that
